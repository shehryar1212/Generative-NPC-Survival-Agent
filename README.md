## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates **Agentic AI** in a real-time simulation. Unlike traditional Game AI (which uses static Behavior Trees like `if health < 50: eat`), this agent uses a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to perceive, reason, and act.

The agent, **Alex**, "sees" the game world via text descriptions, formulates survival strategies (e.g., *"I see a wolf to the West, I should move North to kite it"*), and executes actions.

## ⚙️ How It Works (The Cognitive Loop)

The system separates the **Simulation Layer** (Pygame) from the **Cognitive Layer** (LLM).
